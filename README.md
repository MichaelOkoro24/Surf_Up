# Surf_Up
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
In this module we used SQLite and SQLAlchemy and flask to help W.Avy make a decision on weather to invest in a Surf n' Shake shop. 


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed

-The mean average for June temperatures is 74 degrees
-The mean average of December temperatures is 71 degrees 
-The count for June is more than December so there might be a slight change in the data if the count for december is ran as much as June.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

Overall there is no big difference between the temperature's in June and December. So Oahu should be a good location to open up the Surf n' Shake shop. Since the whether over there is good all year-round. Two additional queries we could add is one about the temperature observed in the last 24 months to see if their was only one good year of whether. Another query could be about which months had the lowest average in the past year.
